Package: python-colorzero
Architecture: all
Section: python
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}, python-pkg-resources
Description: Construct, convert, and manipulate colors in a Pythonic manner.
 Colorzero is a library for working with colors in Python. It is not intended
 to be as comprehensive as colormath, but is intended to be a little easier
 to use, particularly for beginners. The major difference with colorzero is
 that colors are tuples and thus immutable. Standard mathematical operators
 (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) are used to generate new
 colors. Conversions are provided for a wide variety of systems including
 YUV, RGB565, CMYK, CIE Lab, and so on.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
